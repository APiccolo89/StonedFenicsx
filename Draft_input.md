## Input 
I am facing the problem on how to handle the input in a flexible way. There are a plethora of parameters. 
The first conceptual draft is the following: 

input_file -> [list of the data] -> python script that parses this script {and that can be extended}-> sending information to the main file {divide the information into the small classes}
