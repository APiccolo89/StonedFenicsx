# StonedFEniCSx documentation

Documentation of the FEM package **StonedFEniCSx**.
The purpose of the library is to compute the thermal evolution of a subducting plate using the FEniCSx library.  
The project initially started as a Python script (using FieldStone educational framework) and then evolved into a more structured FEM project.
